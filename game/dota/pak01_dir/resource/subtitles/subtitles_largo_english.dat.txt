which have not been changed in the transition to Dota 2 Reborn.
When running under the Source 1 engine, that did not prevent
the game from working because the engine was not designed around
the full capabilities of the minimum spec for graphic cards.
However, Dota 2 Reborn relies on graphics features such as vertex textures and shader model 3.0
and so adherence to the minimum spec is a stronger requirement
than it was in Source 1 Dota 2. Unfortunately this means that Dota 2 Reborn
will not be able to run on some graphics cards from 2006 or before.

	"370278992"	"I really like the atmosphere you bring."
	"4162610044"	"I don't even know how to spend a single sack of gold. What do you need a mountain for?"
	"293586505"	"You probably don't spend much time at the beach, eh?"
	"4285638501"	"Why so serious, bro? Maybe lighten up a bit."
	"415861346"	"Can you breath underwater in that thing? Do you NEED to breath?"
	"252261137"	"Introduce me to that little scribe eh? She sounds like heaps of fun."
	"2516607659"	"My chopper's not quite as sharp as yours -- but my bars might be."
	"3775353405"	"Yeah ok, Bane. But why would you wanna be that way?"
	"140834568"	"Can I have a go? I've always wanted wings."
	"3865744932"	"Sure, I can call ya Karroch. I get why you don't like the other thing."
	"30587683"	"So does the temperture of the blood matter to you?"
	"606363858"	"I can tell you're a bit of a wallflower over there."
	"3391750654"	"You're not meant to be pissed all the time."
	"592028875"	"Bring it in, bro. I don't mind the spikes."
	"3444032999"	"Never met a mum quite like you. You ever keep your little ones in your belly?"
	"1576589430"	"I bet you can get those webs a hummin'."
	"721414368"	"Four on the floor and still hands free."
	"1027559827"	"What do you mean you don't like music? I'm pretty sure your horse is dancing."
	"3543216319"	"You can't just compel people to be your mates, bro."
	"978490762"	"You've looked better, mate. I'm guessing."
	"3562861734"	"But what do you do about all the sweat?"
	"870635937"	"You're a breath of fresh air. A bit too fresh. Anyone got a beanie?"
	"1920911188"	"Music's just math, I've been told. You should try it sometime."
	"3950483182"	"What kind of tunes do they like where you're from?"
	"2624628344"	"Hey, you got any fairy bread?"
	"1964180301"	"You're like a guardian angel. Saving everybody from way up above."
	"2602394209"	"You've got real stage presence, bro."
	"2091208550"	"Yeah, ballads are great. Folks love a good tear-jerker."
	"1801844245"	"I bet you could make music with those crackly things. You ever try?"
	"2238420793"	"You wanna play sometime, Doom? Where's your Six-Hell Six-String?"
	"1812476428"	"I bet dragon scales are on a whole other frequency."
	"2181452576"	"You're icy now, but you'll warm up to me."
	"1706982951"	"I bet nothing's ever too much pressure for you, eh."
	"1078502870"	"Someone told me to get you on drums. Gizza beat?"
	"2923873530"	"I wouldn't call this world broken. Why would you undo all of this?"
	"1193632207"	"So mystic and severe!"
	"2838167779"	"Enchanting...doesn't even begin to do you justice."
	"1318268388"	"Come on, cuz. Gather round."
	"1498649751"	"I bet you keep real good time, mate."
	"3076388283"	"Always nice to meet a fellow artist."
	"1581142158"	"It's good to see a fella stay active in his later years."
	"2955948450"	"You sound kinda familiar..."
	"546253875"	"I think what you really need is a hug. I could use one too."
	"1468538021"	"Looking bloody fierce, bro."
	"3737880664"	"But how do you even see?"
	"1203952098"	"I don't mind a spotlight."
	"818276724"	"Was that your tyke zooming around?"
	"2929818839"	"I'll bring the tunes, you bring the pyro and the lights."
	"3651554369"	"You guys ever try to harmonize?"
	"933768557"	"I almost lost my island too bro. Did you try changing your tune?"
	"3490709610"	"You should try to keep outta the sun, bro. It's not doing wonders for your skin."
	"3352344857"	"Do you even squawk cuz?"
	"1591339171"	"Cuzzy Kez."
	"702470197"	"Oh sorry, mate. We were talking about different kinds of plank."
	"3233643776"	"You call out the tune, I'll play it."
	"783490092"	"I gotta remember: the ones that are hardest to love usually need it the most."
	"3372953899"	"You got a killer smile bro. But you're a touch dead behind the eyes."
	"399534183"	"Do you have to steal the life? Maybe you could just borrow it for bit."
	"4192078155"	"If you and your sister could work together, you'd make a killer duo."
	"280865918"	"Can you still use that hand for regular things? I don't know if I'd trust it in the dunny."
	"4273196370"	"You gotta find yourself some disciples, mate. Instead of just packin' a sad."
	"420208725"	"So you've actually talked to a moon goddess? That's crazy. What's she like?"
	"248207654"	"Can those critters howl in harmony?"
	"3771021322"	"You should toot your own horn. That thing's far out."
	"161914175"	"You're pretty good. You wanna join me band?"
	"2427440261"	"Whistling a happy tune? That's a good one!"
	"3886611475"	"It's the effort that counts, bro. Sing your heart out."
	"1102100"	"Killer 'do."
	"635833061"	"How do you fellas decide who does chores?"
	"3421006793"	"So what are the qualifications to become a priestess of the moon anyway?"
	"579587836"	"Chur, mate! Your rhythm really swings!"
	"3431313360"	"I really like your flow, bro."
	"725451479"	"So does death like music? I thought I could write 'em a song."
	"1023228836"	"That's a real killer voice. All it needs is some twangin' gilly."
	"2784258590"	"You could call your band 'Naga and the Nets'. You can have that one."
	"3539163784"	"Ok, sure, I get it. You're not keen on talking about root notes."
	"999358397"	"Change your outlook a bit and we could cook up a proper infectious groove."
	"3583942289"	"Night time's the right time for a proper gig, eh?"
	"841397142"	"Never thought I'd get a chance to play with a beetle."
	"1941744995"	"You fellas look born for barbershop. If only you weren't tone deaf."
	"2645740623"	"Just smite to the beat and we'll be sweet."
	"1959881082"	"You're the seer, I'm the ear."
	"2598307926"	"So what kind of stuff have you seen out there anyway?"
	"2103911761"	"Your fancy moves, my funky grooves -- can't beat that combo."
	"1789369378"	"Aw, cuz -- smooth as a melody, sharp as a chord!"
	"2225732878"	"Heh -- love that you brought your own accompaniment."
	"1841977403"	"Let's fly high and light this place up."
	"2210674967"	"Wild energy, mate. Let's cause a ruckus."
	"1685853200"	"Tricky moves, mate, but we keep the rhythm tight."
	"1099616225"	"You bring some great chops and catchy hooks. Just like me."
	"2944708301"	"Your spells and my strings -- let's set this place on nether-fire."
	"1189547000"	"Well summon the Queen."
	"3756939842"	"Big pipes, sis!"
	"2833869524"	"Electric energy, mate ... love jamming with you!"
	"1330726867"	"I'll take the spotlight, you handle the sneaky stuff."
	"1485962912"	"Finally! Someone with a sense of showmanship."
	"3063914380"	"You've got that 'savant' look about you. I bet you can play a riff you've only ever heard once."
	"1610365625"	"All I'm saying is you can get everything you like about the desert -- AND MORE -- if you go to the beach."
	"2985450389"	"I hear you've got quite a cult following."
	"1447720594"	"I know you've got soul. Lots of them."
	"3741966959"	"You make 'em dance a much different style than me."
	"822575939"	"Hey, Silencer -- it's ok to let 'em cheer a bit."
	"3630442102"	"Now here's a fella who can hit a proper high note."
	"912934746"	"When you heading out, cuz? I always got my togs."
	"2799000267"	"This fella catches a flow like riding a perfect wave."
	"3520227933"	"We gotta exchange sweet swimming spots, Slark!"
	"2971001784"	"Your Reef was a prison? Yeah, nah. Our one wasn't like that."
	"3323122478"	"They call you Keen Folk? Sweet as!"
	"1595638420"	"Snapfire and Mortimer? Now it's a party!"
	"672969218"	"Always happy to jam with a hotshot."
	"3246331703"	"I reckon when you sing it sounds crazy, Spectre! Real avant-garde."
	"795964955"	"They say you've got a mysterious backstory -- gizza bit?"
	"3368639260"	"Lovin' that positive energy, cuz!"
	"362206782"	"Always an honor to meet a mer of honor!"
	"4221089554"	"All the best shows end in fireworks."
	"318444071"	"You should cough or something. To let a fella know you're coming."
	"4243944203"	"I bet nobody knows the trouble you've seen. Eh, Terrorblade?"
	"458055180"	"You're a handsome fella."
	"2072696809"	"Mind splashin' a little water on me, mate? I could use a lil refreshment."
	"210626431"	"We both love cuttin' it up, but - you know - just in different ways."
	"3800270419"	"We could totally use that thingie for a light show."
	"199238502"	"Hey, let's roll, rock!"
	"3857597002"	"Nice to see at least one of us putting down roots. Oh wait, yours are moving."
	"39219021"	"You may act cranky, but I see that smile when I strum."
	"664843452"	"Chill songs and cold drinks? It's like we were made for each other."
	"3383678352"	"That big cavern you live in must have amazing acoustics. Can I visit?"
	"550334629"	"Those zombie guys could make a pretty good chorus. Except for the rotting vocal cords."
	"3468890505"	"Someone told me you play the cymbols -- is that true?"
	"695942286"	"If you're ever having trouble dealing with the past, maybe try and write a song about it."
	"1052476925"	"First off, huge apologies if my tummy rumbles a bit."
	"3501581521"	"Good to see you, Viper. Maybe don't get too close?"
	"970342884"	"You don't need to worry about my soul, Visage. I'm pretty sure I got that sorted."
	"3621265608"	"You got any music archives at that library? Can I get a peek?"
	"1197948249"	"Infinite realms means infinite venues!"
	"811601359"	"Black grimoire sounds like a fire song book."
	"1912214330"	"You know I control time too, right? It's called tempo!"
	"2683597334"	"The way you string a bow, you'd be good with a guitar."
	"26273717"	"Yeah, just thrum to the rhythm."
	"1989662499"	"It's up to you where you focus your Mana, Auroth. Don't let 'em tell you different."
	"2560210447"	"I wonder if anyone's ever written a song about a witch doctor. I bet it'd be a hit."
	"2132908808"	"Hey, you got problems bro. I don't even know where to start."
	"535171821"	"I wrote your people a couple of protest songs. Wanna hear?"
	"1759584891"	"I'm just saying, you'd be a whole lot nicer to direct storms away from people. What gives?"
	"4058543041"	"You must know heaps of spoony songs from your wild days."
	"1666419871"	"Oh, keen as! Who's that little cuzzy in the bucket?"
	"1602839239"	"Hrggh"
	"3330290557"	"Hmmm"

	"2724179133"	"Mm!"
	"3150972301"	"Magic river candy."
	"995556615"	"Now I'm really in tune."
	"1280429457"	"That's the good stuff."
	"3724981496"	"It's one hit after another."
	"1192224066"	"Wait'll you hear this."
	"805885396"	"Hey have you heard?"
	"2926329975"	"Rock and roll."
	"3647697121"	"Time for a bit of show and tell."
	"1080172891"	"Everything's a drum if you pound hard enough."
	"929370573"	"Don't interrupt."
	"2017879055"	"Don't interrupt."
	"2816085084"	"You're outta tune."
	"3504159946"	"Hey time to play."

	"1469309521"	"Mind the strummer."
	"3228582304"	"Shall we dance?"
	"1501106202"	"Find your own gig."
	"780017804"	"What do you reckon?"
	"1160138175"	"What do you reckon?"
	"3200335133"	"Let's go to the hop!"
	"3385200011"	"A little chin music."
	"2604132076"	"You're a broken record, mate."
	"3962623610"	"Now you're in the deep stuff."
	"1966704576"	"Wanna hear a deep cut?"
	"37664598"	"Time to tune you up."
	"2623152885"	"Here comes a little chin music."
	"3948745315"	"Alright mate, bit of a tussle then!"
	"1918125017"	"Just a quick scrap, promise."
	"89355087"	"Ay, don't take it personal!"
	"2515300062"	"Reckon I'll handle this one."
	"3807075912"	"Sorry, mate. Wrong place."
	"2183976877"	"No worries -- I'll swing first."
	"4113295163"	"Just settin' the tempo, mate."
	"1814214273"	"Let's dance a little, ay?"
	"455443991"	"Alright, alright, we're doin' this."

	"4064682786"	"Enjoy my greatest hits!"
	"1800368792"	"Bruisin' you to the beat!"
	"474497550"	"I'm shredding while I'm shredding, bro!"
	"2365022111"	"Striking a chord!"
	"4226838281"	"Fighting, dancing, what's the difference, ay?"
	"3446489450"	"It's not a concert without a mosh pit."
	"3127538172"	"Battle of the bands!"
	"593698886"	"Lots of good music comes from a place of pain!"
	"1415844048"	"The rhythm is gonna getcha!"
	"3389031795"	"Turning this battle up to eleven."

	"880181497"	"Oh is that first blood? Was it me?"
	"2853311834"	"Never pick a fight with a bard."
	"3709150668"	"First blood? This place'll be chocka block in no time."
	"1142715510"	"First blood. Don't blame me. It's a risky business."
	"857425120"	"First blood? I don't really care about that."
	"2745457009"	"First blood. It is what it is. Better my way than his."
	"3567479271"	"First blood. That's not my usual score..."
	"3026509826"	"First blood. I'm not sure if it's a good sign or a bad sign that it went to me."

	"3451410598"	"First blood! Hope that wasn't a fan."
	"2672407489"	"First blood and I haven't even finished my first song!"
	"4263617715"	"Slam dance."

	"271566239"	"Oh, you gotta meet my little friends."
	"1680029283"	"Oh, you gotta meet my little friend."

	"3640827120"	"Am I standing straight?"
	"2610724214"	"Immortality!"
	"43330764"	"Let's put it on repeat."
	"1972509786"	"I reckon we'll need an encore."
	"74825339"	"I got a real good feeling: this one's in the bag."
	"2642210753"	"This one's gotta be in the bag. I already wrote a bloody song about it."
	"3933986647"	"I don't want to spoil the surprise, but I've got a bag wrapped up and ready to go."
	"1948207860"	"History isn't written by the victors, it's written by the bards. But in my case, it can be both."
	"51935842"	"Is the fat lady singing yet? Cuz, this one is in the bag."
	"2584816600"	"Just follow the beat, mates, and we can't be beat."
	"3977648974"	"Big finish coming. Enjoy the show!"
	"2108229343"	"When we're done here, they're gonna be cheering for an encore."
	"179189321"	"If we don't get a standing ovation when this is over, I'll eat a sandy jandal."
	"1785315244"	"I'm already tuning up for the victory song."
	"493784890"	"Put it in the bag and drop it in the bucket."
	"967451176"	"Invisibility."
	"2695066514"	"But they can still hear me right?"
	"3617866500"	"I dunno if I like this."
	"598322118"	"I don't think this one fits."
	"3131112060"	"I don't even know what it does."
	"3450325738"	"Oh, I could definitely use this."
	"1405312841"	"I could play all day."
	"616853471"	"Now it's time to really shred."
	"3184344677"	"Folks get rowdy when the tempo's up."

	"984783495"	"Wait, is that what I ordered?"
	"2746993469"	"This one's pretty gnarly."
	"3569154987"	"It's nearly a bargain."
	"1255697928"	"Cheap as for what you get."
	"1038048926"	"I don' t know why but my tummy's rumbling."
	"2765492004"	"I could get another drop of this."
	"3553705906"	"My mates all got these for free..."
	"1131291171"	"Is this the premium type?"
	"879301301"	"That's a deep cut."
	"1721301458"	"If you wanna play the hits..."
	"295684420"	"Sometimes you eat the frog and sometimes the frog eats you."
	"2291570942"	"Sounds a little bleak."
	"4287735912"	"Mean looking blade."
	"1643462091"	"Practically selling it for a song."
	"384961885"	"Don't really see the need."
	"2415615207"	"They'll be dancing at the show tonight."
	"4177292401"	"You never know who's eavesdropping."
	"1749250528"	"Strange accoustics in here."
	"524566902"	"Just for water, yeah?"
	"2139342995"	"That's otherworldly. You got a story behind it?"
	"142931973"	"Oh, 'divine' is right!"
	"2441980351"	"You gotta let it move ya."
	"3867842857"	"Have a squiz through this."
	"2028866698"	"That's a strange trip."
	"266943516"	"We all get a bit shy sometimes."
	"2531290534"	"Too much gold's not actually a good thing."
	"3790036272"	"Is it your shout?"
	"1901609121"	"I've always got a song in my heart."
	"106917943"	"Maybe they'll shut up and listen for once."
	"818044500"	"But I don't really like it."

	"703208438"	"Sometimes I play more like a composer..."
	"1592601440"	"It's a lot harder on the battlefield than the beach."
	"203210759"	"It's all the hassling. It's messed up my head space."
	"2065428625"	"And I'm the one who wrote the stinking song."
	"3979881729"	"What a cock-up."

	"2419090059"	"Eh, not my best work."
	"1975548067"	"Ah, that was ... just a warm-up."
	"352842054"	"Not exactly a banger. All good, though."
	"1644216784"	"I can see why some people scalped their tickets."
	"4211708010"	"Yeah, nah."
	"3270355807"	"Yeah, nah."
	"2349768956"	"I think I've got a frog in my frog throat!"

	"215182772"	"Friends in better days, eh?"
	"2077515042"	"Hey I'm chill, but I'm not that chill."
	"3853568129"	"Didn't anybody tell you? Never make a happy big guy mad."
	"2461530135"	"Maybe there's a silver lining. Sometimes inspiration comes from a really dark place."
	"197044653"	"Yeah, nah."
	"2092538171"	"Maybe try again?"
	"3959850154"	"Next time, practice till you get it right."

	"2157314046"	"Aww stink!"
	"4153593704"	"Bugger all to do now!"
	"1777752779"	"Time to face the music..."
	"519137885"	"Watch 'em try and blame me for this."
	"2281192423"	"It's not my fault this lot can't carry a tune."
	"4043246449"	"I told 'em we shoulda had more practice."
	"180347296"	"Choice feed, this."
	"2478223386"	"Wow, I feel good."
	"3836838028"	"Oh! We don't have these where I'm from. They're great."
	"2060784943"	"A whole new world of flavor to explore."
	"231876025"	"They taste like magic."
	"3696870849"	"Missing top."
	"1162908795"	"Missing middle."
	"844604653"	"Missing bottom."
	"3945495938"	"We didn't always live on the island."
	"1914842168"	"Our ancestors lived in the most beautiful swamp."
	"86318254"	"Until a great evil crept into our homeland..."
	"2604763405"	"And drove our people into the sea."
	"4187935340"	"We were swamp folk. Not made for life at sea."
	"1620542422"	"The waves went on forever and gave us nothing."
	"395359040"	"It was then, as we lay hopeless and dying, that one of us started to sing."
	"2314479331"	"He didn't sing to save us."
	"4277343861"	"Only to keep us from dying afraid."
	"1744455631"	"But something in the sea heard him."
	"285046617"	"And what should have been our death song..."
	"2151836360"	"Became our salvation."
	"1092793609"	"The Island had heard us."
	"3626755251"	"It had answered our song."
	"2938950693"	"A massive LIVING creature."
	"826818950"	"Velu'Mar -- The Island That Comes."
	"1179611408"	"Our new home."
	"3745915050"	"For a thousand years our people sang the sacred song that kept the Island happy."
	"2822836284"	"And the island gave us... Everything."
	"3707080112"	"It protected us from outsiders."
	"1174199306"	"It provided shelter and supplies."
	"855370908"	"It blessed our wormponds with nutrients and rain."
	"2896132415"	"And we continued to sing."
	"3684190633"	"But eventually, The Song stopped working."
	"1116805139"	"The Island stopped LISTENING."
	"899033221"	"And instead? It started to die."
	"1682565845"	"Honestly, that could have been the end of it. The end of us."
	"4248877935"	"But my teacher, Elder Moro -- even on his deathbed -- well, he was wiser than most."
	"2319944697"	"He figured out the Island wanted to hear NEW songs!"
	"337845850"	"Not the same song over and over again for a thousand years."
	"1663315660"	"And, humbly or otherwise, that's where I came in."
	"4197285750"	"I had to figure out WHICH new tunes to groove."
	"2368360416"	"And, MORE importantly, I helped figure out that the Island wanted ALL of our people to sing along."
	"496325233"	"The music comes from all of us."
	"1787978471"	"The Bard Monks were never supposed to do it all alone."
	"173402882"	"Now, the old stories are true again."
	"2102582164"	"The Island is happy, and all of our people thrive."
	"3831204398"	"You wanna hear the best part? I get to hit the road to find new inspiration."
	"2472327864"	"Then I just hop back home and share with everyone there."
	"221785883"	"Who knows -- maybe some day more folks will join me out here."
	"2050957197"	"But for now everyone's happy right where they are."
	"3811986999"	"They're happy and the Island's happy -- that's all that matters to me."
	"3921057194"	"Hey, while we're here. What's YOUR favorite story?"
	"1891615760"	"Hey do you know any good licks?"
	"129561734"	"So what do you like to play?"
	"2581356837"	"What's that? Sorry -- I lost my train of thought."
	"1996244283"	"When I was younger, I thought Elder Moro's stories were boring."
	"4025816193"	"But now I like to tell his stories."
	"2566005783"	"Except I play them MY way."
	"110539188"	"Because he's the one that taught me: "
	"1905361186"	"We can honor the songs of our elders without fear of changing the tune."
	"3902328984"	"Old stories can lose their meaning."
	"2678054926"	"Knowledge that once was sacred will all be forgotten in time."
	"253820319"	"And if we let our song of worship grow stale..."
	"2015874313"	"Even the god that we play to will eventually wither and die."
	"417350892"	"In the end, the music of life doesn't come from tradition, it only comes from the heart."
	"3460309598"	"Sure, sometimes I do miss the Island. "
	"1464431588"	"But we get to see so many new places."
	"541999986"	"And after we see enough, we always make a bit of time to go back."
	"3190478545"	"Gotta share our new tunes with everyone."
	"3375228487"	"Especially with the Island."
	"1344583677"	"The two of us have got a real connection."
	"2518888968"	"Life on the road's pretty good."
	"254436274"	"The hardest part is keeping tabs on the little ones."
	"2016236324"	"They're always hopping off."
	"3863594631"	"If you've got a tongue for trouble, stick on THEIR trail."
	"2437871121"	"Somehow they always know how to find a good time."
	"782194029"	"When it's time to go home? We gotta sing for it bro."
	"3080062167"	"The Island is never in the same place."
	"3230741569"	"It's a sensational place to visit."
	"1593156066"	"Real shame I can't tell you where it is."
	"703762804"	"For your own safety, of course."
	"2969288910"	"She doesn't like strangers."
	"1009449603"	"Our ancestors couldn't survive at sea."
	"2770578233"	"But after generations of living on the Island, we're all good."
	"3525614511"	"The salt doesn't phase me."
	"1279266316"	"Yeah, nah. We're all good."
	"1853178586"	"Yeah, nah. We're all good."
	"1997220480"	"What, over there? Yeah."
	"2528958907"	"What, over there? Yeah."
	"3993140026"	"Yeah!"
	"2567261100"	"Yeah, sure."
	"1018499376"	"Yeah, sure."
	"123854351"	"Nah, yeah."
	"3596949791"	"Nah, yeah."
	"1885793945"	"Choice spot, I can tell."
	"3916414755"	"All good. I can strum as we stroll."
	"2657652661"	"Yeah, I could go for a tramp."
	"3017246311"	"Yeah, yeah, I could go for a tramp."
	"249008676"	"Hardout."
	"3954480689"	"Bro, hardout."
	"2043716274"	"Anybody see a path?"
	"420948823"	"Get a wriggle on."
	"325097326"	"Come on, get a wriggle on."
	"1846549441"	"We'll get it sorted."
	"4145629819"	"Yeah, I reckon."
	"3110690789"	"Yeah, I reckon."
	"3463343987"	"Bro, I reckon."
	"2149481197"	"We'll go with the flow."
	"511373134"	"Let's get this toad on the road."
	"1769856984"	"Chur, bro."
	"616458076"	"Chur, bro."
	"4034170466"	"Wanna come with?"
	"2272509684"	"There's the spot."
	"399287141"	"She'll be right."
	"3604266881"	"She'll be right."
	"2714996503"	"She'll be right."
	"1623954419"	"Oh you bet."
	"1852365028"	"Oh you bet."
	"842692756"	"Fingers and toes."
	"1161644034"	"Strummin' and strollin'."
	"3694401976"	"Why ask why?"
	"2872256814"	"Slow is pro."
	"894942349"	"It'll be a real trip."
	"1112575003"	"Sand on the soles."
	"3680099745"	"Sure, flat tack."
	"2891902263"	"Count me in."
	"1021440166"	"Must be the place."
	"1273413680"	"Oh, I reckon."
	"723601877"	"One note follows another."
	"1546025283"	"Time for a tiki tour?"
	"3508314987"	"Time for a tiki tour."
	"3308202233"	"You ever hear the one about the spikewhale and the spongefish?"
	"3282635909"	"You ever hear the one about the spikewhale and the spongefish? Classic"
	"743214540"	"No worries."
	"1531690330"	"All good."
	"1585329212"	"All good."
	"3259165920"	"I'll hop to it."
	"3041254518"	"Let's have a wander."
	"637190631"	"Feet first, worries later."
	"1392374129"	"Go with the flow, bro."
	"1684070162"	"This way looks choice."
	"325578628"	"I'll lead, you lot keep up."
	"2322513470"	"Get a wriggle on, team."
	"4251553448"	"Time to strum and stroll."
	"1661803275"	"Let's play a walking beat."
	"336210845"	"Good day for a meander."
	"2365815335"	"Righto, keep it movin'."
	"4194585265"	"Stepping to the rhythm!"
	"1790662432"	"Every step is a note in the song of your life."
	"498886582"	"Better get to my next venue!"
	"2105273939"	"The music just makes me want to move!"
	"175955653"	"I get my sweetest song ideas while walking."
	"2473955199"	"Does anyone have directions to the stage?"
	"219224796"	"Kicking the dust off my jandals. "
	"2484620134"	"Far out, mate, I'm walking far out!"
	"977715139"	"Maybe we could sit?"
	"2739924601"	"Just gizza sec?"
	"3561545455"	"I'm not feeling it."
	"1244416844"	"Yep, still hurts."
	"1026259930"	"Ride the groove."
	"2753702496"	"I been better."
	"3542424310"	"No hurry."
	"882718705"	"Sensational."
	"1415233044"	"Better broken legs than broken fingers."
	"593333890"	"If it's not one thing, it's another..."
	"3558115429"	"No..."
	"1293801951"	"Yeah nah bro."
	"974763811"	"Yeah nah bro."
	"974842185"	"No!"
	"2191904838"	"No!"
	"2759752938"	"Noooo!"
	"1157999516"	"No mana..."
	"3691837990"	"No mana."
	"2869676720"	"No mana, bro."
	"896491283"	"I'm out of mana..."
	"1114140549"	"Outta mana."
	"3680583231"	"Hey, I'm outta mana."
	"2892369577"	"I need mana..."
	"1020859192"	"I need mana."
	"1272849326"	"I really need mana."
	"723102283"	"Got any mana?"
	"1545509597"	"Need some mana."
	"3306670951"	"Get me some mana."
	"2987457521"	"Got mana?"
	"745827922"	"How 'bout some mana?"
	"1534287556"	"Not without mana!"
	"1221682379"	"Not ready..."
	"3520607601"	"Not ready."
	"2799633895"	"Not ready!"
	"951816260"	"Need some time..."
	"1337762002"	"Need time."
	"3602248040"	"I need time for that!"
	"2712846846"	"It's not time..."
	"822991983"	"Quit buggin' me."
	"1175121145"	"Bug off!"
	"650994972"	"Not yet..."
	"1372214666"	"Not yet, eh."
	"3368223792"	"You gotta learn to wait!"
	"3217306790"	"I'm not ready."
	"564175109"	"Feel free to wait."
	"1453822355"	"Stuff off with it!"
	"2699055225"	"It's ours as much as anyone's."
	"971571651"	"Now this outpost can be our friend."
	"1324233045"	"You ever wonder who built all these?"
	"3498747126"	"Killer spot for a show."
	"2811073632"	"How do I hit the lights?"
	"2126066092"	"Ahh"
	"3887095830"	"Ohh"
	"2427932800"	"Ahhh"
	"248759587"	"Uffahh"
	"2043999669"	"Ahhh"
	"3772621839"	"Ohhh"
	"2547684505"	"Hmmm"
	"124094728"	"Ahhhh"
	"1774078517"	"Gizza good one eh?"
	"4038531983"	"That's finer than frog fuzz."
	"2276469529"	"That's a lotta dough."
	"433372858"	"Aw she's a beaut."
	"1859358252"	"Show me something I've never ever seen before."
	"3044403410"	"Regeneration."
	"746371432"	"I could play all night with this."
	"1534822910"	"I got a tune for that. But this works too."
	"1995806855"	"Well, not every show's gonna be a hit."
	"4026321213"	"That road'll wear you down."
	"2566650283"	"It's like water off a frog's back."
	"111111176"	"Just strum it off."
	"1905810590"	"All good, all good. That was just a practice run."
	"3901820196"	"I feel sensational, bro. I'm good as."
	"2677423538"	"Well that's one way to slice a frog."
	"254353443"	"Stuffed if I know..."
	"1645056916"	"Stuffed if I know..."
	"2016284853"	"Surprisingly, I feel all better."
	"417962320"	"Never a dull moment around here."
	"1877912006"	"Well what a day that was."
	"4142397564"	"My feet are all wet."
	"2178992362"	"No worries. I still got my strummer."
	"528768329"	"I was just a bit under the weather."
	"1753443807"	"Tough crowd round here."
	"4052368485"	"We'll get there. Island time, you know?"
	"2257390835"	"That's not the kind of beating I prefer."
	"372380002"	"Anyway, so where was I?"
	"1630872052"	"I'm back with bells and shells on."
	"868534931"	"Clean as a whistle, fit as a fiddle -- all that jazz."
	"1153694213"	"You wouldn't believe what I've been through."
	"2247658405"	"I wish I could bottle up that mist. Adds a lot of mystery to the air."
	"1811344009"	"The real gold was the friends you got killed along the way."
	"2190823356"	"No need to be so cold, brother."
	"1822109328"	"No magic here, bro. Just real good music."
	"2334327703"	"Holy smokes. How'd I survive that?"
	"2632170212"	"Oh, were we fighting? I thought that was dancing."
	"1928190920"	"My nightmare? An audience full of people like you."
	"2609807101"	"What a lasso."
	"1971331025"	"You're a better drummer than a fighter and you drum like shit."
	"2453156566"	"All that blood, bro... What a mess!"
	"1505789963"	"Cut this guy open and grog pours out."
	"2963483966"	"You might not think it, but you should never turn your back on a bard."
	"1588415506"	"Your webs were just humming with music. Wasn't that sweet?"
	"3105186069"	"Your hoof stomp was way off beat."
	"2933250150"	"Yeah, I didn't figure you for a fan."
	"1088141642"	"I figured no one in your band could carry a tune."
	"2847415423"	"I think it's nobler in the mind for you to just die already."
	"1203141971"	"All that clanking was messing up my groove."
	"2685292628"	"I'm cold blooded. You're just insane."
	"3784593057"	"I'm not going to insult your intelligence. You're doing just fine at that."
	"261762957"	"I told you to stay away from my little friends."
	"3875113656"	"The lights were on, but nobody home."
	"150465428"	"Is that one of those 'clown' things I read about? Wasn't that scary."
	"4014982803"	"I cue'd up a sad one when I saw you coming. You've got the look."
	"4170153952"	"Sorry, nothing stops this show."
	"377560780"	"It's all doom and gloom until I bust out the right tune."
	"4293049337"	"You really got a get a handle on that temper."
	"300735189"	"I hear Drow have shit taste in music."
	"4132763602"	"Boulders turn into sand, mate."
	"3550620707"	"That was almost bang on, bro. Almost."
	"1034702095"	"Shrug it off. Your past failures were way bigger."
	"3570395194"	"As long as your inner fire's still burning, it doesn't matter that your body's stone dead."
	"985762070"	"That's for messing with my mind. Aw, geez. Now I'm crying. "
	"3715736593"	"There's a big difference between gravity and charm."
	"3401129314"	"You should have stopped time and thought about that one for a while longer."
	"616004686"	"Oh, I see. You're not an artist. You're a bloody hack."
	"3453278587"	"I don't think I'll keep down all that racket after all."
	"601536599"	"I guess not skux enough."
	"2899964032"	"I guess not skux enough."
	"3294795088"	"You burned bright. You died young."
	"1294008749"	"You could have changed music forever. But now you're just dead."
	"2737791105"	"I learned a long time ago how to deal with a diva."
	"1246545332"	"Two heads are deader than one."
	"2755830936"	"That's as far as dogma will get you. You need to find a mind behind the mask."
	"1140492703"	"You were gonna hurt yourself and others. I did what I thought was right."
	"1413099756"	"I thought he'd never stop chirpin'."
	"3123990976"	"Don't let it sink your spirits, mate."
	"1398273269"	"Not the command performance you were looking for."
	"3176764889"	"I get on with most folks, but this guy's a real prick."
	"1524742366"	"All that talk about a bottomless pool -- but in the end you died at sea level."
	"2218451346"	"Yeah, nah. I'll take a rain check on that shit."
	"1781825726"	"That's one way to turn fire into steam. Or is that just smoldering ash?"
	"4098888989"	"Can't boil this frog! Not today."
	"2203526539"	"Yah, nah, that name 'Lion' don't really fit."
	"1834566823"	"Sorry, bro. The end of the song works a whole lot better if you're dead."
	"2330028448"	"Haha, looks like this time my tongue got the cat!"
	"2636239059"	"I don't really play the blues. So all that howling was too much."
	"1932505599"	"I like the strings, but I can play the horn when I gotta."
	"2588677322"	"Someone called her a whistler, but she punched like a percussionist."
	"1950512614"	"Life in Mars? Not any more there isn't."
	"3841812599"	"You really need to work on those triplets, mate."
	"2482657505"	"Even one forked tongue is too many."
	"3054273296"	"I'm buggered after this one. That little guy was everywhere!"
	"1476583996"	"You ever hear the one about the frog who killed a princess?"
	"2975942409"	"Clever feet, monkey man, but I call the tune."
	"1601119781"	"Down the dunny you go."
	"3486530484"	"The tide may be high, but I'm holding on."
	"3101100834"	"Killer aim, but you're just not hitting the right notes."
	"2937565777"	"Oi, no wriggling your way out of this jam!"
	"907994091"	"I try to keep my head above the water."
	"1092211581"	"My ax sings, and the tree falls."
	"2826597960"	"Aw, mate. I compose -- and you just decompose."
	"1182013284"	"Heh. For a boogeyman, you can't dance to save your life."
	"2714516067"	"Where do they dig these guys up?"
	"1926951638"	"Where do they dig these guys up?"
	"2538673152"	"Sorry, mate -- not the first bug I've caught, won't be the last."
	"3763741846"	"So not just two heads, but also two left feet."
	"240666042"	"Should've come to play, not to pray, bro."
	"3879461007"	"That's why I go with the flow. I don't wanna fret about the future."
	"154501539"	"Yeah, nah. I'm not into all that astral crap."
	"4002262180"	"Fancy moves, bro -- shame you were off the beat."
	"4182578647"	"You're light on your feet, but you weren't ready for the tempo change."
	"390296827"	"You brought the band, but I got the solo."
	"4263563726"	"What can you do? A lot of stars die too young."
	"271495394"	"Poor guy. At least we got some saussies out of it."
	"2157030771"	"I guess music slays the savage beast..."
	"4153843173"	"Tried to hush the frog, eh? You just missed the beat."
	"3529524756"	"Nice one. But I didn't mind the flies, eh?"
	"1265178542"	"Good effort mate, but still a bit sloppy with it."
	"1013851960"	"Who let you in here? This show wasn't all-ages."
	"3574432269"	"For all that blinking and screaming, you fell a bit flat eh?"
	"990110497"	"All that buzz, but the jam's fizzled out!"
	"3703295526"	"Takes more than a little puff of smoke to throw me off."
	"3413866325"	"Heh. Looks like center stage belongs to the frog, bro."
	"628430457"	"Sticky fingers, but you can't lift my riffs."
	"3424039756"	"Guess you just couldn't dig my groove."
	"572052064"	"Oi, cuz -- your toxic tricks can't touch these sweet licks."
	"3315662695"	"I shoulda figured -- looks like all your souls were appropriated."
	"1289972634"	"For the last time, I'm not gonna play the chicken dance."
	"2733443766"	"You wouldn't be the first to tell me to pipe down. Yeah, good luck with that."
	"1267642243"	"Aw -- looks like an angel, squawks like a sick parrot."
	"2776682159"	"Thought you could make a splash? Nah, bro -- wipeout."
	"1111024552"	"Slark, you aren't that slick, mate."
	"587164237"	"You can't just slip out before the concert's done!"
	"1442339547"	"No offense to you about this, Mortimer."
	"630369876"	"Turn that gun into a trumpet and you'd be playing a happy tune."
	"1385537218"	"I don't know if that thing understood my language, but I hope it was digging the tunes."
	"3164340206"	"And that's how you take an ox off the tongue."
	"1529074409"	"I never call off a performance due to the weather."
	"2256297931"	"You can carry a sword but you sure as heck can't carry a tune."
	"1752317671"	"Now we're really blowin' up."
	"2165414866"	"You're sneaky, but I'm sticky."
	"1864366846"	"He said he was in lockup, but he didn't even know any jailhouse tunes."
	"2292701177"	"There are a lot of sea gods -- plenty of 'em aren't always pissed off."
	"3898629660"	"Time for the tide to roll back out, I reckon."
	"2674355850"	"Being green doesn't make me a tree!"
	"1902710694"	"You should really use those smarts to help people, Tinker."
	"2550835859"	"Sometimes you just gotta rock it to 'em."
	"1980025791"	"You mind if I use some of your wood to make a new guitar? Sweet as!"
	"2445076152"	"Chill, cuz. Not everything's about you."
	"3276606943"	"Alright, Angus. Settle down now."
	"3024764233"	"You folks from the cold places really have no chill."
	"1514429541"	"You're never going to make friends acting this way."
	"3005741392"	"Hey man, you don't look so good. Even the dead deserve to relax in peace."
	"1563007100"	"No hard feelings, Ursa. I know you meant well. I mean, I assumed you did. Until you were trying to rip my face off. We never really met."
	"3130111355"	"I hope you find a song that brings you peace."
	"2907769864"	"That's a tasty looking grub. Keep tabs on that spot for later."
	"1130327332"	"Yeah, nah. I don't like snakes."
	"2856110097"	"Yeah, nah, the spooky stuff isn't really my taste."
	"1144170813"	"You could tell this guy was a personality void from the very first word he said."
	"2743764026"	"Sick lyrics, bro. You're a real weirdo."
	"3792739023"	"You can't just rewrite reality like a piece of music."
	"203357155"	"I guess you know where to find the answers, my friend."
	"3850198742"	"Death can be real killer block."
	"192102394"	"That's a real shame. I kinda liked your beat."
	"3972731645"	"Please, bro. No encore."
	"4211846030"	"Maybe a love song would help sort things out with your wife."
	"4038657386"	"Yeah, nah. Why don't you go visit theirs for a bit?"
	"51187058"	"Aghanim's scepter..."
	"2583977160"	"Never thought I'd see one of these."
	"3976424542"	"How do you even set a price on this?"
	"1932312935"	"I thought maybe I could get it for free, but no such luck."
	"3928330461"	"A fraction of the power, a fraction of the price."
	"2636292171"	"I kind of need the whole set."
	"814727924"	"This one feels pretty good."
	"2844169038"	"Now I'm ready for feedback."
	"3733038040"	"Why would anyone wanna hit me?"
	"2758284723"	"Shitty wizard."
	"3053800076"	"Ba na na na baa nanana"
	"3238165018"	"Ba na na na baa nanana"
	"3367253553"	"I'm Largo, and I go. And I go, and I go..."
	"3625536347"	"Ba da da da ba dada da da"
	"907487863"	"Sha na na na na na na na"
	"3517908848"	"Pam pa da da"

	"2151709914"	"Largo"
	"4202172640"	"Largo"
	"2373918838"	"Largo"
	"424226144"	"You can call me Largo."
	"1850613238"	"I'm just the Bard, Largo."
	"4029319253"	"Name's Largo. What's yours?"
	"2267920579"	"You can call me lotsa things. Most folks call me Largo."
	"505735545"	"I like to let my strings do the singing. That way I can still spin yarn."
	"1763957231"	"What's shakin'?"
	"3742584636"	"Hey, what's going on guys?"
	"4187800702"	"Who feels like dancing?"
	"2392585448"	"Time to get a groove on."
	"3999038733"	"Hey, I'm just here to help."
	"2572897691"	"I'll just play myself in."
	"3340253520"	"I'll play myself in."
	"5381153"	"How's your taste in music? It's about to improve."
	"2002070711"	"You're not gonna eat this frog. Not today."
	"1829892571"	"You're not gonna eat this frog. Not today."
	"3912349972"	"Just sit back and I'll play us to the lanes."
	"2654374274"	"Woke up today feelin' a bit froggy."
	"121624632"	"What do I do? I make you lot better."
	"1882777774"	"Just sit back and let the tunes take you away."
	"3767006527"	"Music is power."
	"2541798825"	"Mana is the just the music of life -- any of us can learn to play."
	"3312529102"	"I know all the old songs -- I'm here to play some new ones."
	"2994085464"	"I don't play for money, I play for love. And OK, maybe I enjoy a little bit of the glory."
	"729763810"	"Make music in bad times, make music in good."
	"1551400820"	"Yeah, I like these strings, but I could still make tunes with a piece of driftwood."
	"3256675031"	"Bro! I forgot to think of my entrance music. What's your favorite tune?"
	"3076961202"	"Bro! I forgot to think of my entrance music. What's your favorite tune?"
	"3038501441"	"There's nothing that can ail you the right song can't fix."
	"739412987"	"I've got the tunes, you've got the talent."
	"1528150893"	"I'm always giving lessons."
	"2782075996"	"I'm always giving lessons."
	"3416958716"	"Anyone want to learn how to play?"
	"3165492842"	"As long as we stick together, you've got this."
	"3697942415"	"None of 'em look like music lovers, but we'll change that."
	"2876059417"	"In tune and ready to croon."
	"845446819"	"Let's get this show on the road."
	"1164135989"	"I've got a song in my heart."
	"3674725270"	"I'm here. Let's keep it breezy."
	"2885741312"	"Whatever's goin' on here, we'll sort it. No worries."
	"3534854077"	"Righto! Let's see what kind of tune this place is hummin'."
	"2780210987"	"The Largo concert tour continues! Completely sold out, too!"
	"2469103944"	"All the world's a stage and Largo is playing every show!"
	"2099636324"	"Opening act, headliner, Largo's just happy to play."
	"170055922"	"Nobody tell my tour manager that I took this gig!"
	"2487635281"	"It's bard where I come from, but I reckon around here, you might call me a minstrel?"
	"3812720071"	"I just call it my strummer. My plunker. My twanger. Whatever's good."
	"2051550333"	"I'm Largo. My band's all ready to play."
	"4185820268"	"Ok, pack it in!"
	"1618468310"	"Time to be somewhere else."
	"393276736"	"Well, that's life on the road."
	"2299820259"	"I'll just play myself out."
	"1213779130"	"Just need to hop out for a song."
	"3511786752"	"Life's hard on the road."
	"2790698390"	"Just gonna dance on outta here."
	"942815285"	"Gizza lift?"
	"1915265711"	"Oh thanks."
	"3944870677"	"Choice one."
	"2619786115"	"You were always my favorite mate."

	"3932884482"	"A catchy lick."
	"2060718995"	"A bit sticky."
	"231940869"	"Tongue tied!"
	"1830071008"	"It's my tongue tether."
	"437492342"	"Lickity split."
	"2199571404"	"Just a wag of the tongue."
	"4095605594"	"Hold my tongue."
	"2052401361"	"Hold my tongue?"
	"1786343161"	"Tongue lash!"
	"494820975"	"Tongue tripper!"
	"1597929229"	"Tongue tripper!"
	"2222395349"	"C'mere, bro! Just a quick chat!"
	"4084219715"	"Come say hi to the band!"

	"348656196"	"Come closer, cuz!"
	"1178204451"	"Just borrowin' ya for a sec!"
	"826198453"	"No offense, mate, but you taste awful!"
	"2822215695"	"I'm gonna need some serious mouthwash after that."
	"3744508057"	"At least you taste a lot better than you look!"
	"1096039738"	"Moving you to the front row!"
	"911412652"	"Bro, the music's this way!"
	"2941934614"	"I've got a tongue for trouble."
	"3630001280"	"That's a tongue twister eh."
	"1222799633"	"That trips off the tongue."
	"986045873"	"Just a friendly flick."
	"2748091403"	"Stick close, mate."
	"3570121885"	"You coming or what?"

	"601812208"	"Careful, cuz."
	"844006090"	"From here to there, lickety split."
	"2873611120"	"Wish we'd had one of these on the reef."
	"3695240166"	"Sure, it's freaky. But it's also really convenient."
	"1109685829"	"Time to take a dip. It's cool to the touch."
	"891504339"	"Style points for diving in."
	"3835570580"	"I'm under attack!"
	"2107078702"	"Well that's not good!"
	"177227960"	"They're after me!"

	"2011380350"	"What a crack up!"
	"4008340420"	"Next time maybe do the opposite of that. Just to try it out."
	"2582469458"	"In the rain or in the snow..."
	"156387011"	"I've got blisters on me fingers!"
	"2119530069"	"It's all good. I've got enough love for both of us."
	"748985650"	"OK...Toot your horn. You earned it."
	"3265985566"	"Tastes like kaka."
	"3048066184"	"You ever play a song so good that it wakes a god?"
	"734615851"	"If anyone knows a good agent, I'm looking!"
	"1557031357"	"All toads are frogs, but not all frogs are toads! Now you know!"
	"3318167559"	"Has anyone seen a little tadpole roadie?"
	"3109362843"	"Oi, cuz!"

	"1998855692"	"That's music to my ears."
	"2305690"	"That hit the right notes."
	"2569699104"	"I'll let them take the credit, but I know it was me."
	"3995946934"	"Piece of piss mate!"
	"2094881311"	"Piece of piss mate!"
