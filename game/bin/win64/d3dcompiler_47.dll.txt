By default, unbounded size descriptor tables are disabled to support frame captures in graphics tools. Use of unbounded (or large) size descriptor tables can produce unusually large and potentially unusable frame captures in graphics tools.  Please specify a reasonably small upper bound on table size.  If that isn?t an option, unbounded size descriptor tables can be enabled using the compiler using switch: /enable_unbounded_descriptor_tables

Dependent tex-op sequence too long (%dth order). A 1st order dependent tex-op is a tex[ld*|kill] instruction in which either: (1) an r# reg is input (NOT t# reg), or (2) output r# reg was previously written, now being written AGAIN. A 2nd order dependent tex-op occurs if: a tex-op reads OR WRITES to an r# reg whose contents, BEFORE executing the tex-op, depend (perhaps indirectly) on the outcome of a 1st order dependent tex-op. An (n)th order dependent tex-op derives from an (n-1)th order tex-op. A given tex-op may be dependent to at most 3rd order (ps_2_0/x only

Note that when texcrd is used with a .xy(==.rg) writemask, as it is in this shader, a side effect is that anything previously written to the z(==b) component of the destination r# register is lost and this component becomes uninitialized. In order to read blue again, write to it first. Also: Note that an unfortunate effect of the phase marker earlier in the shader is that the moment it is encountered in certain hardware, values previously written to alpha in any r# register, including the one noted here, are lost.

When aL is used as a relative address, it must not specify any swizzle, as it is a scalar register. Aborting validation
When code ends in subroutine definition, it must end with ret
When constant registers are read multiple times in a single instruction, the _abs modifier must either be present on all of the constants, or none of them
When multple usages are declared for various components of a given input v# register, the _centroid hint can only be specified on either (a) all usages declared for the register, or (b) on none of them.  Also note that the usage 'color' (with any index) has special behavior: even if the centroid hint is not specified for color, it is assumed to be set
When predicate register is used as the condition for a %s instruction, a replicate swizzle must be specified, to select a component. i.e. .x | .y | .z | .w (or rgba equivalent

Indexing into any other declared o# is fine. If relative addressing of o# is not used in the shader, these restrictions on register numbers do not apply

When writing to oDepth, %s instruction must use replicate swizzle on source parameter(s), in order to select single component. i.e. .x | .y | .z | .w (or rgba equivalent
When writing to scalar output (oFog, oPts) with predication, p0 must use a replicate swizzle to select a single component: .x | .y | .z | .w
